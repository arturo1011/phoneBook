      Stylesheets and Preprocessors
      ==============================

      You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
      using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage
      of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

      By default, stylesheets from your `assets/styles` folder are included
      here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less)
      are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
      a single file.

      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:

          + Change the order of your CSS files
          + Import stylesheets from other directories
          + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/app.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/jasny-bootstrap.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/font-awesome.min.css">

    Client-side Templates
    ========================

    HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
    To work their magic, frameworks like React, Vue.js, Angular, Ember, and Backbone
    require that you load these templates client-side.

    By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
    client-side JST templates in your `assets/templates` folder, then
    include them here automatically (between TEMPLATES and TEMPLATES END).

    To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
    For example, here are a few things you could do:

        + Import templates from other directories
        + Use a different view engine (handlebars, dust, pug/jade, etc.)
        + Internationalize your client-side templates using a server-side
          stringfile before they're served.

<!--
    Server-side View Locals
    ========================

    Sometimes, it's convenient to get access to your server-side view locals from
    client-side JavaScript.  This can improve page load times, remove the need for
    extra AJAX requests, and make your client-side code easier to understand and
    to maintain.  Sails provides a simple mechanism for accessing dynamic view
    locals: the "exposeLocalsToBrowser()" view partial.

    For more information on using this built-in feature, see:
    https://sailsjs.com/docs/concepts/views/locals#?escaping-untrusted-data-using-exposelocalstobrowser

  </svg>

</div>

<!--

  Client-side Javascript
  ========================

  You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
  on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
  take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

  By default, files in your `assets/js` folder are included here
  automatically (between SCRIPTS and SCRIPTS END).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
  CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
  and concatenated into a single file.

  To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
  For example, here are a few things you could do:

      + Change the order of your scripts
      + Import scripts from other directories
      + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
